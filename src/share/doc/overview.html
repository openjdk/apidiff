<h1>APIDiff: Overview</h1>

<p>
<code>APIDiff</code> is an API-comparison utility, comparing elements in
different versions of an API, as represented by some combination of source files, class files,
and generated documentation.

<p>
The tool operates by creating an instance of the Java compiler front-end
(as found in the
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/jdk.compiler/module-summary.html"><code>jdk.compiler</code></a> module)
from which it can obtain the selected elements to be compared,
using the
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.compiler/javax/lang/model/package-summary.html">Java Language Model API</a>
and
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/jdk.compiler/com/sun/source/doctree/package-summary.html">Compiler Tree API</a>.

<dt>{@link jdk.codetools.apidiff.model Comparing declarations}
<dd><p style="margin-top:0">
Elements, type mirrors and names obtained from different instances of the
compiler front-end cannot be compared referentially or by using {@link java.lang.Object#equals(Object) equals}.
Instead, API-specific items can be represented in an API-independent manner
using  <em>keys</em> for {@link jdk.codetools.apidiff.model.ElementKey elements} and
{@link jdk.codetools.apidiff.model.TypeMirrorKey types};
they can be identified within an API by means of {@link jdk.codetools.apidiff.model.Position positions};
and corresponding items in different instances of an API can be associated together using
{@link jdk.codetools.apidiff.model.APIMap API maps}, and which can be compared structurally,
using a series of custom "comparator" classes.

<p>
When comparing the API descriptions for each selected element, the tool attempts to find
the relevant content in the API documentation, provided by the
<code>--api-directory</code> option.
The content is extracted from the generated pages using one of two classes:
{@link jdk.codetools.apidiff.model.APIReader APIReader} and
{@link jdk.codetools.apidiff.model.SerializedFormReader SerializedFormReader},
for reading general declaration pages and the "Serialized Form" pages respectively.

<dt>{@link jdk.codetools.apidiff.report Reporting differences}
<dd><p style="margin-top:0">
Differences between corresponding elements in different versions of the API
are reported using the {@link jdk.codetools.apidiff.report.Reporter Reporter}
interface. This interface is the primary means of communication between the
front-end, comparing declarations, and the back-end, generating reports.

<dt>{@link jdk.codetools.apidiff.report Generating reports}
<dd><p style="margin-top:0">
The primary reporter is {@link jdk.codetools.apidiff.report.html.HtmlReporter HtmlReporter}.
This reporter dispatches the reports of any differences to handlers that collect
the information for the individual pages that will be generated once all the
information for each page has been collected.
